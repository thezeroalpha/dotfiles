SML-MODE is a major Emacs mode for editing Standard ML.
It provides syntax highlighting and automatic indentation and
comes with sml-proc which allows interaction with an inferior SML
interactive loop.

This release should work on any recent version of Emacs or XEmacs.
If it doesn't: complain.

Some more or less out of date documentation can be found in TeXinfo format.

Check the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
Check the NEWS file for a list of changes in this version.
Check the BUGS and TODO file before sending me bug reports and requests for
enhancements.

Send any complaint/question/praise/ice-cream to me,
