# Dotfiles & Others Repository
---

Remember: your configuration is *your* configuration (and this is mine).

However, if you _do_ decide to use this, I suggest that you do so more as inspiration, rather than installing everything for a full setup.
That's why I wrote [conf](https://github.com/thezeroalpha/conf) -- to allow modular configuration (also I feel like everyone writes a dotfiles manager at some point).
You choose which configs you want to install, and it'll only install those (and back up your old files too).

What's in this repo:
- `dot.map`: maps the files in this repo to the necessary locations on your system, for use with [conf](https://github.com/thezeroalpha/conf)
- `scripts/`: various scripts that I wrote myself; I use most daily.
- `bin/`: scripts or binaries that I did not write myself

Before you use a custom script, read what it does.
Some may be a bit buggy, I haven't tested them on all systems.
If you read a script and see some improvements that could be made, let me know. I'm always down to learn more stuff.
