These are third-party binaries that I didn't write. I don't take credit for any of them. I only have them in the folder for convenience.

* `find-photo-in-albums.app`: find the albums that contain a photo in Apple Photos
* `wal-init.app`: an app that runs at login to set up pywal
* `AMSTracker`: Retrieves x, y, and z values from AMS (Apple Motion Sensor) hardware.
* `bfg.jar`: the big gun. A repo cleaner to remove sensitive data.
* `class-dump`: dumps classes from binary file
* `gfx2gfx`: convert SWF into PDF. Usage: `gfx2gfx page.swf -o page.pdf`
* `icalBuddy`: can extract information about events from the iCal application
* `k2pdfopt`: a tool to optimise pdfs for mobile readers
* `upx.out`: Fixes a fucked CORE keygen. Check Info.plist in bundle. If the version is lower than system version, and the crash log says "UPX compressed binary", just run `upx.out -d $coreKeygenBinaryPath` and you good.
* `xld`: X lossless decoder CLI.
